#Ruby zfill

I missed the zfill functionality from Python, so I wrote my own. You can see/play with this code at [Repl](https://repl.it/@RiderExMachina/Ruby-zfill#main.rb), including pre-written tests.

I'm still a Ruby novice, so there are probably better ways to handle the errors, but this is what I could do with the time I had.

This code is under the same license as Ruby, which at the time of this writing is the 2-clause BSDL.
